                    Therapy Unit, also called the SpiderCage. These include
                    transitioning from sitting to quadruped, quadruped to
                    kneeling, and transition all the way to standing with the
                    assistance of bungee cords attached to the patient from four
                    angles. This equipment is referred to as the “SpiderCage”
                    due to the eight bungees used to assist the patient.

                  <p>
                    At NAPA Center, we take an individualized approach to
                    therapy because we understand that each child is unique with
                    very specific needs. We embrace differences with an
                    understanding that individualized programs work better. For
                    this reason, no two therapeutic programs are alike. If your
                    child needs our services, we will work closely with you to
                    select the best therapies for them, creating a customized
                    program specific to your child’s needs and your family’s
                    goals. Let your child’s journey begin today by
