                    The NeuroSuit frames the body providing support and

                    supervision of our highly trained physical and occupational
                    therapists. It is made of a vest, shorts, knee and elbow
                    pads, gloves, shoe attachments, and a hat if necessary. All
                    these pieces are interlocked by bungee type cords. These
                    cords assist with proper alignment of the body and
                    essentially frame the body from the outside (external
                    skeleton).

                    While framing the body, the NeuroSuit provides support and
                    resistance simultaneously. It assists the patient’s body to
                    be in correct alignment, while the bungee cords provide a
                    comforting compression to the joints and distribute a
                    vertical weight bearing to the patient’s entire body. This
                    improves and changes proprioception (pressure from the
                    joints, ligaments, and muscles), reduces the child’s
                    undesired reflexes, facilitates proper movement and provides
                    additional weight bearing distributed strategically
                    throughout the body.

                  <p>
                    This sends strong messages to and from the brain and central
                    nervous system bringing about an instantaneous increase in
                    body awareness, which leads to improved motor planning. All
                    the while the child has to work against the effects of the
                    additional gravity from the weight-bearing component of the
                    bungees. They build muscle at a faster pace and the skills
                    they learn are amplified to the central nervous system.
                    Performing specific exercises and functional activities
                    while in the NeuroSuit results in improved motor skills,
                    which carries over into the child’s daily life when they are
                    not in the NeuroSuit.
